    <h1>Lyrics Of Resentment</h1>
    <h4>Verse1</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            <span>
                I need a short term fix for a long term problem. Can I learn to love these chains? <br>
            I know I had a point but now I forgot it While I 'm circling the drain <br>
            No, I can 't stop feeling like every day 's exactly the same With a one track mind I don 't think I can change <br>
            Trapped in memories, stuck on replay, replay, replay
        </span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Refrain</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            <span>
                
            Starts with a spark, then it 's a wildfire Burning me up, burning me up <br> 
            I dance with demons on a high wire Lift me up, lifting me up <br>
            Resentment <br>
</span>
        </p>
    </div>
